 <h2>Jon-Daniel Coombs</h2>
 <p>I'm Jon-Daniel Coombs an otaku, pro-gramer, University Second Year Student, who spends his time, when not gaming, in the kitchen.
    Over the last few years since highschool, I have been exposed to various programming languages and these have fueled my passion toward the different
    area of Computer Science. Once I became discouraged about learning programming as it seemes I lacked the ability to get the knack of it and that was the
    when I stumbled upon Web Development. This opened up a completely new world to me and once again sparked my interests and since then I have used my time to learn programming
    to practice and become better at this area of expertise.</p>
